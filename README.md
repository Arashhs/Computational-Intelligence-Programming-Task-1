# Computational Intelligence Programming Task
Solving NP-Complete problems using Genetic Algorithms and Evolution Strategy for my Computational Intelligence course. In the first code, I solve the Steiner Tree Problem using Genetic Algorithms. Second problem is an optimization problem, I have implemented an ES algorithm to find the global minimum of the Eggholder function.  In the final question, I have implemented a GA algorithm to find an answer for a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) problem.

This is how the ES that I have implemented approximates the global minimum of the Eggholder function (actual global minumum: f(512, 404.2319) = -959.6407)
